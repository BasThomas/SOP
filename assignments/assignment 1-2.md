# Software integrations
## Issue management
For issue management, we are using the built-in `Issues` in [GitHub](https://github.com).

### Merging
We are using [GitHub](https://github.com)'s `Pull requests` to merge commits to a specific branch.

## Version Control
Well, take a look around you! We are using [GitHub](https://github.com) as the VCS.

## Integrated Development Environment
We are using [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/), writing software in [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/).

## Code coverage
We are using the built-in code coverage provided by [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).

### Branches
As for the branching, we are using at least five branches:
- [x] Master
- [x] Major
- [x] Major-team
- [x] Minor
- [x] Bugfix
 
As clarified in [assignment 1-1.md](assignment 1-1):

- The `bugfix` team merges `bugfixes` into a `minor` release. (orange)
- The `testing` team merges `minor` into `major`. (green)
- One of the `major` teams merges `major-team` into `major`. (blue)
- The `testing` team then merges `major` into `master`. (green)
